### 3. Technical Requirements

#### 3.1 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**:  
  - **Next.js**: React framework for server-side rendering, routing, and optimized performance.  
  - **TypeScript**: Static typing for improved code quality and maintainability.  
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid, responsive UI development.  
- **Backend (if needed)**:  
  - **Firebase**:  
    - **Realtime Database or Firestore**: Store game state, player data, and table information.  
    - **Authentication**: Optional anonymous or email-based login for user persistence.  
    - **Cloud Functions**: Handle game logic (e.g., hand evaluation, pot distribution) if offloaded from client.  
- **Other Tools**:  
  - **WebSocket (via Firebase Realtime Database)**: Real-time updates for multiplayer sync.  
  - **Vercel**: Deployment platform for Next.js.

#### 3.2 System Architecture
- **Client-Side**:  
  - Next.js app renders the UI and handles local game state for each player.  
  - TypeScript ensures type-safe card, player, and game logic.  
  - Tailwind CSS styles the interface responsively.  
- **Server-Side (Firebase)**:  
  - Manages multiplayer synchronization (e.g., whose turn it is, current bets).  
  - Stores persistent data (e.g., player chips, table state).  
- **Communication**:  
  - Real-time updates via Firebase listeners/subscriptions.  
  - Client-side validation with server-side enforcement for critical actions (e.g., bet amounts).

#### 3.3 Data Models
- **Player**:
  ```typescript
  interface Player {
    id: string;           // Unique identifier (e.g., Firebase UID)
    name: string;         // Display name
    chips: number;        // Current chip stack
    holeCards: Card[];    // Array of 2 cards
    position: number;     // Seat at table (0-9)
    isActive: boolean;    // Still in hand?
    hasFolded: boolean;   // Folded this hand?
  }
  ```

#### 3.4 Game Logic
- **Card Deck**:
  - Standard 52-card deck with 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades).
  interface Card {
    rank: string;         // "2", "3", ..., "10", "J", "Q", "K", "A"
    suit: string;         // "hearts", "diamonds", "clubs", "spades"
  }
- **Table**:
  ```typescript
  interface Table {
    id: string;           // Unique table ID
    players: Player[];    // Array of players
    communityCards: Card[]; // Up to 5 cards
    pot: number;          // Total chips in pot
    currentBet: number;   // Highest bet to call
  dealerPosition: number; // Index of dealer button
  phase: string;        // "preflop", "flop", "turn", "river", "showdown"
}

### 4. User Stories
- As a player, I want to join a table so I can start playing Texas Hold'em with others.
- As a player, I want to see my hole cards and the community cards clearly so I can make informed decisions.
- As a player, I want real-time updates on bets and actions so I know whatâ€™s happening in the game.
- As a player, I want to chat with others at the table to enhance the social experience.
- As a new player, I want a tutorial mode so I can learn the rules before playing multiplayer.

### 5. Design and UI Guidelines
- Layout: Circular table layout with player positions, central community cards, and pot display.
- Colors: Poker-themed palette (green felt background, black/red/white chips).
- Responsiveness: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS (e.g., stack player info vertically on small screens).
- Animations: Subtle transitions for card dealing and chip movements (CSS or Framer Motion).

### 6. Development Milestones
- Phase 1: Core Setup
  - Set up Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
  - Build static UI for lobby and game table.
  - Implement basic game logic (card dealing, hand evaluation) client-side.
- Phase 2: Multiplayer Integration
  - Integrate Firebase for real-time database and synchronization.
  - Add multiplayer functionality (join table, sync game state).
  - Implement betting rounds and turn management.
- Phase 3: Polish and Features
  - Add chat functionality and settings.
  - Implement tutorial mode with simple AI.
  - Optimize UI/UX with animations and responsiveness.
- Phase 4: Testing and Deployment
  - Test edge cases (e.g., ties, disconnects).
  - Deploy to Vercel with Firebase backend.
  - Conduct beta testing with real users.

### 7. Assumptions and Constraints
- Assumptions:
  - Players have stable internet for real-time play.
  - Firebase free tier is sufficient for initial scale (up to 100 concurrent users).
- Constraints:
  - No real-money gambling (chips are virtual).
  - Limited to No-Limit Texas Hold'em initially (other variants later).

### 8. Success Metrics
- Engagement: Average session time >15 minutes.
- Retention: 50% of users return within a week.
- Stability: <1% crash rate during gameplay.

### 9. Future Enhancements
- Leaderboards and player stats.
- Customizable avatars and table themes.
- Support for Pot-Limit and Limit variants.
- AI opponents for offline play.

### 10. Implementation Notes for Developers
- Next.js: Use API routes for local game logic testing before Firebase integration.
- TypeScript: Define strict interfaces for cards, players, and game state to prevent bugs.
- Tailwind CSS: Leverage custom config for poker-specific styles (e.g., bg-felt-green).
- Firebase: Use Realtime Database for simplicity, switching to Firestore if complex queries are needed later.
